## My Portfolio Presentation

This application is my personal REACT job portfolio. This will be used for any job searches or freelance work. It will give any potential clients or future employers a glimpse into who I am and what my work is like. You will find there is an about me section, a list of all my skills, recent projects, my resume, and contact information. 

Here is the link to my launched site: [Hamlet Valladares React Portfolio]()
